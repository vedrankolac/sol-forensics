# Minimal Solana blockchain explorer
This chain explorer was built with React using [solscan.io](https://solscan.io/) API. If it's not wroking it probably needs to be aligned with solscan.io API updaates.

It is fairly simple. I have made it as a prof of a concept for a client to (better?:) navige the endless wormhole of relations of crypto tokens and its holders.
